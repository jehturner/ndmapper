Before sketching out process

o Add file access modes in DataFile.
  - This is done but do we want to add a self._clobber attribute for later
    use when writing to disk and/or set the _dirty attribute?
o Implement NDLater.

Later

o IRAF tests with additional files (inc. VAR/DQ).
o Complete logging behaviour.
o Add auto .fits (and other known types) in DataFile?
o Capture stdout/stderr?
o Save functionality.
