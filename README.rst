ndmapper
========

A module representing astronomical datasets as collections of AstroPy NDData
instances, mapped to named files on disk, with the aim of constructing
intelligible data reduction processes.

A wrapper for integrating IRAF tasks into the processing scheme, some simple
functionality for managing calibration associations and a library of data
processing functions/wrappers (currently for GMOS IFU) are intended to be
moved to a separate "ndprocess" module as this prototype nears completion.
